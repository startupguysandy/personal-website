    <h1>Ripple Experiment</h1>
    <p>I saw the ripple animation YouTube had on their buttons and really liked how the animation was simple while also portraying when an action had actually happened.</p>
    <p>Rather than implement the material design example code from Googles website I decided to research and implement the animation myself, the end result is a smooth animation which is lightweight as well as teaching me some really important css as well as Javascript classes.</p>
    <p>For example I learnt how about the debounce functionality, which is a really important concept.</p>

    <button ripple>
